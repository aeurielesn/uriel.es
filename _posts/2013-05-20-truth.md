I consider truth very very important. At some point in my university life
I decided to never say a lie again, not even a white lie.

However, I reserve the right to speak it. I can't expect everyone to be
able to handle the truth and in such a case I would kindly refuse to answer a
question.

Still, no lies. I only speak the truth.
